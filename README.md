### Purpose of the Program

This program reads and edits a `FileStructure` data structure containing car records (`CarRecord`), and then allows you to save the modified data back to a binary file. The program displays the structure’s fields and enables value changes, including selecting variants for enum fields from predefined lists.

---

### Environmental Requirements

1. **`carindex.def` file**  
   Must be located in the same folder as the executable (EXE).  
   The size and data format must match the structures described in the code.

2. **`headers.txt` file**  
   Must be located in the same folder as the EXE.  
   File format: each line is a `key=value` pair, where:
   - The `key` corresponds to the name of a structure field (e.g., `carNameId`, `enumA`, `zeroOrFour`, etc.)
   - The `value` is a human-readable name or description of that field.  
   
   These headers will be displayed on the form for the user’s convenience.

3. **`enums.txt` file**  
   Must be located in the same folder as the EXE.  
   File format:
   - Enum sections are marked as `[enum_name]`
   - Each section contains lines in the format `ItemName=Value`
   - Values can be in hexadecimal `0x..` or decimal format.

### Brief Description of the Workflow

- Upon startup, the application reads the structure from `carindex.def`.
- It then loads field headers from `headers.txt` and enum variants from `enums.txt`.
- The data of the first car (by default `index = 0`) is displayed on the form.
- The user can switch between cars (81 records total) using the `Next Car` and `Previous Car` buttons.
- The user can modify string fields, integer fields, and select from dropdown lists for enum fields.
- By clicking `Save`, the changes are written back into the structure and saved to the original binary file `carindex.def`.
